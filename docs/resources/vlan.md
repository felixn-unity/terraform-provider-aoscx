# aoscx_vlan (Resource)

The `aoscx_vlan` resource manages VLAN configurations on AOS-CX switches. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) provide logical network segmentation within the physical switch infrastructure.

## Example Usage

### Basic VLAN Configuration

```terraform
resource "aoscx_vlan" "production" {
  vlan_id     = 100
  name        = "production-vlan"
  description = "Production network VLAN"
  admin_state = "up"
}
```

### Multiple VLANs with Different States

```terraform
resource "aoscx_vlan" "development" {
  vlan_id     = 200
  name        = "dev-vlan"
  description = "Development environment"
  admin_state = "up"
}

resource "aoscx_vlan" "staging" {
  vlan_id     = 300
  name        = "staging-vlan"
  description = "Staging environment"
  admin_state = "down"  # Initially disabled
}

resource "aoscx_vlan" "guest" {
  vlan_id     = 500
  name        = "guest-network"
  description = "Guest access network"
  admin_state = "up"
}
```

### VLAN for Management

```terraform
resource "aoscx_vlan" "management" {
  vlan_id     = 10
  name        = "mgmt-vlan"
  description = "Management VLAN for network devices"
  admin_state = "up"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

### Required

- `vlan_id` (Number) - The VLAN ID. Must be between 1 and 4094. This is the unique identifier for the VLAN and cannot be changed after creation.
- `name` (String) - The name of the VLAN. This is a human-readable identifier for the VLAN.

### Optional

- `admin_state` (String) - Administrative state of the VLAN. Valid values are `"up"` (default) or `"down"`. When set to `"down"`, the VLAN is administratively disabled.
- `description` (String) - Description of the VLAN. Useful for documenting the purpose or usage of the VLAN.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` (String) - The ID of this resource, which corresponds to the VLAN ID.

## Import

VLANs can be imported using their VLAN ID:

```bash
terraform import aoscx_vlan.example 100
```

## Notes

- VLAN 1 is the default VLAN and typically exists by default on most switches
- VLAN IDs 4095 is reserved and cannot be used
- Deleting a VLAN will remove it from all interfaces where it's configured
- Ensure no interfaces are actively using the VLAN before deletion to avoid connectivity issues
